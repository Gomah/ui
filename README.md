# UI Stuff

Just a play around with components, tired to create these little pieces all the time, hopefully this can be a strong base in the future.

### Todo

- Define foundations (tokens), although TailwindCSS have pretty good defaults

### Existential questions

- How do we define multiple variants combination? It currently feels like a limitation and doesn't feel super right, a bit weird to declare variants theme based in `Button.tsx` or `Badge.tex`... Is tailwind the right tool?
- Use tailwindcss or Vanilla extract?
- Use radix? If yes, with tailwindcss or Vanilla extract?
- Use twmerge (if using tailwindcss ?)
- Use css module? Is it good/best practices to use it with tailwindcss?
- How to make it customisable ? Probably need to make something work first to then think about it.
- package.json per component?
- How to make sure components are tree-shakable?
