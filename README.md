# UI Playground

[Ladle](https://acme-ui-react.vercel.app/)

Just a playground with components, tired to create these little pieces all the time, maybe this can be a strong base in the future.

### Todo

- Define foundations (tokens) (in W3C Design token format), although TailwindCSS have pretty good defaults?
- Make components more polymorphic

### Random questions for myself

- Is tailwindcss + Vanilla extract the right combo?
- Use radix? If yes, how do we combine it with tailwindcss or Vanilla extract?
- Use css module? Is it good/best practices to use it with tailwindcss?
- How to make it customisable? Probably need to make something work first to then think about it.
- package.json per component?
- How to make sure components are tree-shakable?
- Support multiple frameworks?
